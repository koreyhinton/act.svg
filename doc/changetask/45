DECISION NODES EXTENDED IN SIZE TO HOLD TEXT
type    =    extension

In the bottom URL bar, add a Decision link with a variety of sizes; currently
there will be no way for the user to resize the ones given by the extension.


The usual way of doing decision nodes:

               | 
               v  
 reg. user___ / \___ super user
          |   \ /   |
          v         v

Now there could be text within the Decision node:

               |
         ______v_________
no  ___ / is super user? \___ yes
    |   \________________/   |
    v                        v
