CT/52      V0.2      XML-EDITING               MACRO-LEVEL XML EDITOR    FTR
Before clicking 'Start', there is a chance to edit the full raw XML and deal
with it on a text-based basis (e.g. paste in to integrate elements from multiple
svg docs, etc). A lot of editing can then happen at the micro level by selecting
a particular element and a smaller text editor appears just for that 1 element,
while the fuller text editor is read-only. In order to edit the full xml text
you have to copy it and then refresh the page to paste in and use the full
editor again.

There are a lot of reasons why someone might want to edit the full xml text
in the middle of an editing session, here's a few:
    1) make sure a new element has a certain ordering (before/after certain
       other nodes)
    2) when the attributes are trivial in text mode, ie: place node at (0,0),
       then editing the text is easier than trying to get corret x,y with mouse
    3) Give a fill to all elements, ie: search and replace all instances of
       fill="transparent" with fill="#FFF"
    4) uniformity of elements, e.g. quickly scan and find all elements with
       x approx equal to 100 and edit one after the other until all have x
       equal to 100.
