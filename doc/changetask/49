setx 100  # set all x to be 100
incx 100  # increment all x be 100
setw 120  # set all width to be 120
incw 120  # increment all selected width to be 120

Update: to keep things a consistent UI, use multiline and allow multiple command
entries. Since multiline is enabled, it might as well autofill the relevant
commands with their current values, e.g.:
    setx 103
    incx 0

Update 2: incx, incy should get updated values as you drag nodes, so the user
can see to place it back where it started

Update 3: can be ; delimited. setx 3; sety 4
Update 4: broke out parse and node attr logic so they can be unit tested
independently from what else is going on globally/DOM
