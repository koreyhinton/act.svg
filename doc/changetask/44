         cursor in mid-draw
         and right-click interrupts


Results in a new rect drawn:
  _____
    .  )
 (_____  _ 
        (_)

. => left-click position to close menu

And then when closing the menu by left clicking to the left of the menu
(e.g. click in the center of the 1st rectangle),
and the 2nd rect goes invisible and causes errors due to having a negative width:
    <rect rx="10" ry="10" x="228" y="191" width="-14" height="0" stroke="black" fill="transparent" stroke-width="1" id="rect2"/>

  _____
       )
 (_____  
        => second rect is here but now invisible


Console error in Log:
    
    index.js:522 Error: <rect> attribute width: A negative value is not valid. ("-112")
    window.updateFrames	@	index.js:522
    window.manageDrawUpdate	@	node-manage.js:321
    window.mousemove	@	index.js:952
    
Line 522 reference:
    In [../../index.js]
        In window.updateFrames
            svg.innerHTML = xml;        // causes error message


Now new issues will show up, one being that this rect can no longer be selected with click-drag
selection rectangle:

............
.  _____   .
.       )  .
. (_____   .
...........^   mode 0, click drag to select

results in no selection on mouse up:

  _____
       )
 (_____  



Fix:

In [../../index.js]
    In window.mousedown
        e = e || window.event;
        + if (e.button > 0) return; // only handle mouse down for left-click events (0 button)


Assured by tests:

Test that right-clicking and then left-clicking off doesn't add a second rect and that no rect
is there having -width nor -height:
    [test/node_management_tdd.js] #54

Test same workflow as above mentioned test, except add on an extra step ensuring that the original
rect can be selected:
    [test/node_management_tdd.js] #55
