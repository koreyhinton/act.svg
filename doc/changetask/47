CT/47      V0.3      NODE-DRAWING              4S DECISION ND RESIZE     FTR
Dragging the decision node right or left draws changes the drawn width.
Dragging it up or down changes the drawn height.

This allows drawing it large enough to hold text

Update: originally I thought the click-drag flexible sizing feature would
also handle drawing normal (4-line) decision nodes but larger in size.
However, the drag logic would have to determine if its a 4-line or 6-line.

Backlog: a configuration item of 'default decision node size' can be configured.
This task: A single click creates a 4-line decision node whereas a click-drag
(of noticeable sized movement) creates a flexible 6-line polyline.

Click (4-line):

Click-Drag (6-line):

Update 2: this task will focus on the reshaping between 4-sided and 6-sided

Update 3: this task will solely be focused on re-sizing a 4-sided decision node,
          for 6-sided see CT/48
