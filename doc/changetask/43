QUICKLY SELECTING TO REMOVE START ELEMENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SELECT ELEMENTS
IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT WAITING FIRST

     click then immediately go to select elements in the svg area

       should have started the selection rectangle but instead it did the normal
       select html page behavior.

Fix:
    In [../../index.js]
        In window.onStart
            - window.gDispatch(function(){document.onmousedown = mousedown; document.onmousemove = mousemove; document.onmouseup = mouseup; }, 800);// skip first click
            + window.gDispatch(
            +     function(){
            +         document.onmousedown = mousedown;
            +         document.onmousemove = mousemove;
            +         document.onmouseup = mouseup;
            +     }, // end dispatch callback
            +     8
            + );// skip first click

No Test Assurance:

Since the gDispatch function does not wait in test mode (test mode skips the
setTimeouts), this fix wouldn't be very testable. Ideally this should be
remediated to see if this dispatch call can be removed altogether.
