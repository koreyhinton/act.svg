What's supposed to happen is the text editor brings up the edit screen for the 
text element (so you can place your own text in place of the '?', however
instead it gets the polyline:
    <polyline points="107 113 107 150 97 140 107 150 117 140" stroke="black" fill="transparent" stroke-width="1" id="polyline1"/>

After fix it should have brought up this text in the textarea instead:
    <text x="117" y="134" fill="#CAFFB5" id="text1">?</text>

Fix:

Instead of clicking at the point of the left-most edge of a newly created text
element, instead click at the original click point.

In [../../index.js]
    In window.issueClick
        In if (numMode == 9) {
            - issueClick(adjX, adjY);    updateFrames();
            + /*step1*/issueClick(x, y);
            + /*step2*/updateFrames();
