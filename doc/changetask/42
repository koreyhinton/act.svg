PASTING XML TEXT (E.G. HEX COLOR) IN NODE TEXT EDIT
SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO PASTE NODES, JUST DO THE NORMAL TEXT IN EDITOR PASTE
type    =    bug

Bring up the editor for a particular node, and then paste in a fill color and
it will try to to do the node paste callbacks in addition to the normal text
paste.

The error says testCb is not a function, which is true because the test didn't
directly test the test callback way for testing node paste, but rather
unintentionally went down this path from a normal text edit paste.

Error:

[js/node-manage.js]
    In window.issuePaste
        if (window.gTest) { testCb(); } // causes console error:
Uncaught TypeError: testCb is not a function

Fix:

[js/node-manage.js]
    In window.addEventListener("paste"
        - if (window.gStarted) {
        + if (window.gStarted &&
        +     window.getComputedStyle(document.getElementById("editModalBG"))
        +         .visibility != "visible"
        + ) {
              ..
              window.issuePaste();
