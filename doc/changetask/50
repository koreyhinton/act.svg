CT/50      V0.2      NODE-DRAWING              ABLE TO RESIZE EACH NODE  FTR
same as ct/48 except for all the other types that already have resize behavior
on the initial draw action.

By clicking on an end part of a node and start dragging in select mode it will
start resizing.

   \
    \
    \/
       \__  e.g. click arrow point
            and drag starts resizing it in mode=0

To avoid interfering with selection, it will only activate re-size behavior
if the node is already selected.

Also, should be able to resize multiple at once (e.g., select 3 rects in a line
and resize all 3 to be a larger width).
