CT/64      V0.3      NODE-MAPPING              MAP TYPE SYNTAX           FTR

Syntax for user to choose propagation to sub-selected nodes.

->^ propagate the delta (default)
->  propagate the value
    no propagation

<rect
    x="123->^"
    y="123->"
    height="100"
etc>

example above explained

    x propagates by delta (e.g., change 123->^ to be 125->^ then sub-
    selected nodes will change by their own x +2).

    y propagates by value (e.g., change 123 to be 123-> then sub-selected nodes
    will change to all be y=123)

    height does not propagate to subselected nodes.

Ideally, this would work for start position and end position (or width/height)
and possibly any number value and ideally you could even opt in for '->' to
propagate non-number values like stroke color (->^ wouldn't work, can't/
shouldn't diff a color hex). However, for this initial task it will
only build on top of what's already working which is start position 
(x/x1/x2/cx/polyline-x, y/y1/y2/cy/polyline-y).

Also, a future task could include a centering propagate indicator, maybe ->|,
and all sub-selected nodes would align with horizontal (x="1->|") or vertical
(y="1->|") centering.
