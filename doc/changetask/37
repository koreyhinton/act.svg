DRAG FROM OUTSIDE SELECTED RECT  SHOULD CANCEL RECT SELECTION
type    =    bug


1. Start new selection to select inner text elements outside the selected rect:
     *******   ....
    * text1 *  .  . 
    * text2 *  ^...
    *       *  |
     *******   new selection cursor

2. drag to surround the inner text elements results in moving
   the selected rect (bug):

             ......
      text1  .    . 
      text2  .    .
             .    .
     ||||||| ^.....
    |       |
    |       | 
    |       |
     |||||||


After the bug is fixed, #2 should instead keep the rect in-place and the inner
text will actually not be selected since the drag is cancelling a current
selection, and the rect is now de-selected.

  ...|||||||.......
  . | text1 |     . 
  . | text2 |     .
  ^.|.......|......  
     |||||||

Test that assures the fix
* test #48 [test/node_management_tdd.js]

Fix:

window.mvShouldCancel = function(x,y) {
    return Math.abs(window.gRectSelectState.firstX-x)>18 ||
        Math.abs(window.gRectSelectState.firstY-y)>18;
}
In window.mvIsMove:
    In NotMoving-CanMove Condition
        if (window.mvShouldCancel(x,y)) {
            return false;
        }
